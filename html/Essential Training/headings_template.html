    <P>HTML Essential Training Formating page content In this series of exercises,
    we'll explore how to use HTML elements to format basic page content. Adding
    headings
    
      Headings help define the structure of the page and control the hierarchy
      of the content. You can use heading values ranging from a top-level
      heading of h1 all the way down to an h6. While there are several competing
      theories on the exact strategy to use when choosing headings, what really
      matters is that you are using then in an intelligent manner, to accurately
      reflect the importance of your content. It's also important to be
      consistent in how you use headings across your site, so deciding on when
      and how ot use headings is an imporntant part of planning your site.
    
    Using paragraghs
    
      The paragraph tag ((p)) is one of the most basic formating tags, and one
      that you'll use often. It indicates a paragraph of text, and should be
      used for each individual paragraph.
    

    Line breaks
    
      Occasionally you'll need to perform a "soft return," that is, create new
      line without using a new paragraph. To do that in HTML, you will use the
      line break tag((br)). Line break tags are inline, meaning you can use them
      within headers and paragraphs, and don't require a closing tag. Let's say
      you were formating an address, for example. You could use line breaks to
      make suere each line of the address appeared on a separate line, but still
      remained within the same paragraph. lynda.com 6410 Via Real Carpinteria,
