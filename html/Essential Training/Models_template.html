<h1>Content models</h1>
<p>In HTML 4 there were only two main content models, block and inline level elements. <b> Block level</b> elements would stack on 
    top of each other in normal document flow while <b>inline level</b> elements typically appear within the flow of text content.</p>

<p>In this example the <b>heading 1 </b> and the <b>paragraphs</b> are block level items, while the bold tags and the link below are examples of 
    inline level elements.</p>

<p> In HTML5 new content models have been created to expand the structure semantic capabilities of HTML. There are seven main models:
    <b>Flow, Metadata, Embeded, Interactive, Heading, Praphrasing, and Sectioning.</b> To learn more about them, visit the interactive graphic
